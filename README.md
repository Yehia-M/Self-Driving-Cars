# Self-Driving-Cars
Projects and Assignments for Self-Driving Cars Specialization on Coursera
* Project1
  * Kinematic Bicycle Model - The model accepts velocity and steering rate inputs and steps through the bicycle kinematic equations.
  * Longitudinal Vehicle Model -The model accepts throttle inputs and steps through the longitudinal dynamic equations. 

* Project2
  * Controller for the CARLA simulator. 
  * Goal is to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints. 
  * The vehicle needs to reach these waypoints at certain desired speeds, so both longitudinal and lateral control are required.
